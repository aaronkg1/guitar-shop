They give the Stratocaster a tight, warm sound with enhanced trebles and heaps of definition. Boasting a 9.5" fretboard radius and a 1.65" string nut, the guitar's C-profile neck allows for comfortably grasped, complex chords as well as extreme bends and add to this instrument's immense versatility. The vintage-style synchronised tremolo is just begging to produce those death-defying dive bombs Jimi himself performed during his iconic rendition of the 'Star Spangled Banner' at Woodstock.`,

      description: `For nearly 60 years, George Benson has captivated audiences the world over as one of the best performers and recording artists of all-time. Crossing into multiple musical genres during his storied career, George has built a reputation as one of the most versatile, talented and respected guitarists in history. For over 40 years, George and Ibanez have worked together seamlessly, first by realizing George’s vision for his ideal electric hollow body guitar, the GB10 in 1977. Since then, there has been many other successful collaborations on George’s signature guitars, and Ibanez is now proud to announce the GB10EM, the most affordable GB models ever offered. As one of the most influential guitarists to ever pick up the instrument, George wanted to offer a signature guitar that was not only a great guitar but also accessible and obtainable to all players everywhere. Retaining some of the most integral signature appointments of the GB line, including the floating mini-humbucking pickups, compact fully hollow jazz guitar body, and iconic GB headstock inlay, the GB10EM has proved itself worthy of the name ""GB"", as deemed by the man himself, George Benson.`,

      model: "PRS John Mayer Silver Sky",
      colour: "Grey",
      price: 2695,
      description: `The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

      Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.
      
      The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.
      
      Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.`,

Epiphone’s long friendship with Mr. Les Paul began in 1940 when Les built one of the world’s first solid body electric guitars while working nights at the original Epiphone factory in Manhattan. Les’ first solidbody guitar, nicknamed “the Log”, would go on to inspire the Les Paul Standard, what many consider the greatest electric guitar ever made.`,
